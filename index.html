            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>My name is Shane Malamut! I grew up the DC Area and I'm currently a student at James Madison University, studying Computer Science and Entrepreneurship. This summer I am working in Reston VA as an intern for Ellucian's Product Team! I have a passion for coding, games, music and storytelling. I will be graduating May 2026, and I intend on starting my career as a Software Engineer.</p>
            <h2>What You'll Find Here:</h2>
            <p>In the Software Projects page, you'll find the software applications I'm most proud of. These tend to be team projects, productivity-related tools and miscellaneous other projects.
                <br>In the Games page, you'll find the video games I've created!
                <br>In the music page, you'll find the music I've produced and posted online! I make music digitally using Garageband.
            </p>
            <h2>Future Plans:</h2>
            <p>I hope to do a lot more with making video games and various app ideas. Some programming topics I'm particularly interested in learning are Rust, Java Spring, Javascript React, and mobile app development. I'm also always working on some kind of music project in the background.</p>
